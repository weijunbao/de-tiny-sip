A SipContact holds information about the remote contact to call. It can be a SIP user or a regular phone number.

A SIP contact consists of a user name and his SIP domain. For example bob@company.com, where bob is the user name and company.com the SIP domain.

A phone number looks like this: 0123456789@provider.com. The provider has to support the redirection of SIP calls through the PSTN by a gateway.
