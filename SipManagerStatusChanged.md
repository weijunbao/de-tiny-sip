The SipManagerStatusChanged event is raised by the SipManager when a change of state occurs. Your application is required to act accordingly. This might by just displaying the current state to the user or changing the UI.

Since the SipManager runs on a different thread than the UI, even the event happens on that thread. This means that all changes on the UI should be placed inside a `this.runOnUiThread(new Runnable(){}` statement. See the TinySipDemo for an example.
